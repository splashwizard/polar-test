     * This is used when we have to create a copy of a dictionary to prevent concurrent mutation
     * or when we need to copy it and then make changes to the new dictionary.
     *
     * The values in the map could be arrays, other dictionaries, sets, maps, strings, arrays, etc.
     *
     * Make sure to handle all cases.
     *
     * This needs to be fully recursive including dictionaries contain other dictionaries

     * - To test if a variable is an object:
     *
     * typeof val === 'object'
     *
     * - To test if a variable is an array:
     *
     * Array.isArray(object)
     *
     * - To get all the keys of an object you can call Object.keys(dict)
     *
     * - If you are given an array as input it should return an array as output.
